Sudoku solution using a backtracking algorithm.

The Sudoku class is instantiated with a 81 number string representing the board from left to right of the top row all the way to the bottom. Empty cells are represented by "0".

'#board' will return the current board in string format, separated by lines.

'#solve!' will run the backtracking algorithm and modify the current board to its solution.
